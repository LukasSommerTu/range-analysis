Please visit our former page for information about the Range Analysis:
https://code.google.com/archive/p/range-analysis/

We haven't had time to migrate our wiki pages to GitHub.

The most important thing is: Range Analysis is kept updated. So just download and use it.

Any question? Email me at victorsc -at dcc.ufmg.br
